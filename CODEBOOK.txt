The tidy data set that can be obtained as a result of running run_analysis.R script contains averaged values of mean() and std() (average and standard deviation) measured features. Data comes from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, available under: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

Data set contains 180 observations of 68 variables.

Identyfing variables are:

subject - indicates the number of participant, who took part in the measurement. Ranges from 1 to 30.

activity - indicates the activity, to which other values are corresponding. Possible values: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS. In total there 6 different values.

Rest of variables are normalized (values in range [-1,1]) and averaged pairs of values corresponding to mean and standard deviation of:

tBodyAcc-XYZ - body acceleration for axes X,Y,Z
tGravityAcc-XYZ - gravity acceleration for axes X,Y,Z
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ - Jerk signals for axes X,Y,Z
tBodyGyro-XYZ - Jerk signals for axes X,Y,Z
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ - Jerk signals for axes X,Y,Z
